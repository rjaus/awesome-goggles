For the purpose of Goggles, we created a DSL (Domain SpecificLanguage) which will allow users to express rules able to capture flexible filtering logic applied on a large set of search results. This DSL needed to be plain text and self-contained to ease hosting and sharing, flexible enough to express fine-grained filtering logic of URLs and page features, yet sufficiently constrained so that filtering can be implemented in a very efficient way (as mentioned previ-ously, this system needs to be able to match thousands of candidate results against thousands of rules for each user query, without impacting latency in a perceivable way). Finally, it needed to be accessible enough so that even people without a technical background could quickly grasp its syntax and write rules, which would also encourage collaboration around the creation and curation of Goggles(e.g. communities)
